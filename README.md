# autoTaskSwitchKey
Pressing alt+esc periodically with mouse moving by digispark

DigiMouse and DigiKeyboard designed for digispark cannot be complied if they are used at the same time,
but mouse and keyboard support in TrinketHidCombo has no such problems.
(you cannot use TrinketMouse and trinketKeyboard at the same time, neither. Be sure to use TrinketHidCombo)
