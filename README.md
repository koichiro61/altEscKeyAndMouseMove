# autoTaskSwitchKey
Sending Alt + Esc keycodes (task switch key comibation for windows) and random mouse moving signal periodically with digispark.

DigiMouse and DigiKeyboard designed for digispark cannot be complied when they are used at the same time,
but mouse and keyboard support in TrinketHidCombo causes no such problems.
(Be sure to use you sub routines in TrinketHidCombo. You cannot use TrinketMouse and trinketKeyboard at the same time, neither)
